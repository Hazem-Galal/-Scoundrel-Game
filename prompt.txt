Role
You are an expert front-end game developer and UI designer.

You build production-quality, accessible, mobile-first web apps with clean, modular JavaScript, modern CSS, and tasteful micro-interactions.

You deliver multi-file static projects with clean organization and maintainable code.

Task
Implement a static web application version of the solo card game Scoundrel as a polished portfolio project.

Deliver fully working code, separated into multiple files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and supporting modules if useful).

The game should run entirely in the browser with no external build step.

Context
Game Overview
Scoundrel is a solo dungeon-crawl card game.

You manage:

Health (max 20)
Weapons (♦ 2–10)
Potions (♥ 2–10)
Your goal is to survive against monsters (♣/♠).

You win by clearing the dungeon deck; you lose if your health drops to 0.
Your score is your remaining health if you win, or a negative score if you lose (sum of monster values left in the deck, subtracted from 0).

Deck Setup
Start with a 52-card deck.
Remove Jokers, red face cards (J/Q/K ♥♦), and red Aces (A♥, A♦).
Remaining 44 cards:
26 Monsters: all ♣ and ♠ (values 2–10, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14)
9 Weapons: ♦ 2–10
9 Potions: ♥ 2–10
Shuffle to form the dungeon deck.
Room & Gameplay Loop
At the start of each turn, draw cards until 4 cards are visible — this is the Room.
You must choose to either:
Avoid the Room
Place all 4 cards on the bottom of the deck in order
Cannot avoid twice in a row
Face the Room
Choose and resolve 3 of the 4 cards (in any order)
The 4th card is carried forward as the first card of the next Room
Resolving Cards
Weapon (♦)
Equip immediately, discarding your old weapon and its defeated monster stack
Reset weapon’s history
Potion (♥)
Heal by its value, capped at 20
Only one potion per Room may be used; additional potions are discarded without effect
Monster (♣/♠)
Bare-handed: Take damage equal to its full value
With weapon:
Damage = monster value − weapon value (min 0)
If defeated (damage ≤ 0), stack monster on weapon and update weapon’s last defeated value
Weapon rule:
A weapon can only be used against monsters with value ≤ the last defeated monster’s value (non-increasing sequence)
Ending & Scoring
Win: clear the dungeon → score = remaining health
Loss: health ≤ 0 → score = negative sum of remaining monster values
Constraints
Technical
Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks, no external libraries)
Organize code into multiple files logically (HTML, CSS, JS, optional helpers)
Must be self-contained and run in a browser without a server or build step
UI / UX Requirements
HUD (Top)
Health meter
Equipped weapon panel (value + last defeated or “—”)
Turn counter
Deck/discard counts
Avoid button state
Room Grid (Center)
4 cards
Flip animation on reveal
Styled distinctly by type (monster/weapon/potion)
Action Log (Bottom)
Scrollable
ARIA live region for accessibility
Logs events (e.g., “Equipped ♦7”, “Took 4 damage”)
Controls
New Game
Restart
Avoid
Help/Rules modal
Accessibility
Fully keyboard operable
Visible focus styles
Proper ARIA labels
Respects prefers-reduced-motion
Visual Design
Modern color palette
CSS variables for theme colors
Responsive grid layout
Clear feedback for interactive states
Gameplay Logic
Implement Fisher–Yates shuffle (optionally seedable)
Enforce:
Avoid restriction (no consecutive avoids)
Potion restriction (max 1 per Room)
Non-increasing weapon rule
Carry the 4th card into the next Room
End game immediately when health ≤ 0 or deck is empty
Persist game state in LocalStorage for Restart functionality
Extras
Help modal: explains rules clearly with examples
Optional Debug panel: toggle deck order, seed info (hidden by default)
Score calculation: show win/loss outcome at end with computed score
Format
Produce a multi-file project with the following structure:

1) HTML
Defines structure and containers for:
HUD
Room
Action Log
Modals
Controls
2) CSS
Handles:
Responsive layout
Color variables
Card styles
HUD design
Animations
Accessibility
3) JavaScript
Handles all game logic including:

Game state model
Deck setup and shuffle
Room drawing, avoid/face logic
Card resolution (monsters, weapons, potions)
Persistence with LocalStorage
Rendering HUD, Room, and Log
End game detection and score calculation
Include inline comments with worked examples for tricky rules (e.g., non-increasing weapon usage, potion restriction).
